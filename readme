• Created a Python script that uses the Python Requests package to send HTTP queries.
• The user is prompted by the script to provide the URL and request method (such as GET, POST,
PUT, or DELETE).
• Also, the user has the option to edit headers and parameters and supply information for POST and
PUT requests.
• The script sends the HTTP request and receives the response using the requests module.
• A text file is used to hold the response of the requested URL.
• When JSON parsing fails, the script handles exceptions and prints the response’s headers, content,
and body to the console.
